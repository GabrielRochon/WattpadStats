# WattpadStats
Wattpad Stats tracks your Wattpad story's stats using a web scraper. It helps you track your progress and the exposure of your novel on the platform. 

# Version 1.0
First version of the snippet. Currently extracts & stores in a text file:
- Readers count
- Viewers count
- # of parts

# Plans for future 
- Rankings
  - Although this would only work for the English version of Wattpad, as it is the basic language when accessing it via a fresh browser. This is problematic for people like me which publish stories in another language.
- Increase from yesterday
  - How many reads/viewers/parts/ranks(?) have I earned since the last time data was extracted?
